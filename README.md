[Jake Vanderplas Data Analysis Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZEWDGpM-vM)

The link above is an excellent tutorial by Jake Vanderplas to create a Notebook for Data Analysis. It captures the entire flow from a concept to coding, testing, and code refactoring. Along the way pytest framework and working with github is introduced. I have followed through the entire tutorial. And I have retained the scratch areas to make sure that the read understands the process and followed through the entire series. They scratch notebooks are names as scratch and some of them will have versions (example: Jvander-1.ipynb, Jvander-2.ipynb, etc)

I will try and writeup as much as possible to make the **self-explanatory tutorial** by Jake easier. That said, it is ideal that everyone follow through the entire process and create the notebooks and the process from scratch.

This is intended for someone who is an expert on Notebook based Data Analysis and want to quickly reference Jakes' tutorial without creating the Notebooks.
